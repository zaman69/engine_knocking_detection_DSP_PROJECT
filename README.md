- ✅ Sample datasets (if applicable)
- ✅ Project documentation (if available)
- ✅ Signal plots and analysis results

## 🎯 Objective

To apply core DSP techniques (filtering, FFT, noise reduction, etc.) for identifying knocking signatures in automotive engine signals.

## 🎓 Academic Context

- **Course**: Digital Signal Processing (Sessional)
- **Level**: Final Year Undergraduate
- **Tool Used**: MATLAB
- **Focus**: Real-world application of DSP in automotive diagnostics

## 📌 Note for Viewers

This project may be particularly interesting for those with **prior knowledge of automotive engine dynamics**, especially engine knocking phenomena. It demonstrates how signal processing principles can be effectively applied to solve practical engineering problems.
